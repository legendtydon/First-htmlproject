        <h2>Plants</h2>
        <p>A plant is a main part of <strong>food chains</strong> and our every day life.
            A plants life cycle seems easy but, it is not as easy as you might 
            have thought.<br/><br/> A plants first starts from a seed and then sprouts into
            a seedling the it keeps growing limbs and leaves, then flowers start to bloom.
            A flower can be a sign that a plant is about to bear fruit, but some plants do not bear
            fruIt, such as the rose.
        
        </p>
        <div href="#Life cycle">
        <h2>Life Cycle</h2>
        <p> A plant before it sprouts has <em>three</em> main processes
            it goes through.<br/><br/>In this section we will Talk about...
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Pollination</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Fertilization</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Germination</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Pollination</h2>
        <p>Pollination is the first step of a seed making.<br/><br/> Pollinators such as <em>Insects</em> and <em>Birds</em>
        go from plant to plant to collect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nectar" target="_blank">Nectar</a></p>
        <p>As it is going from plant to plant, pollen(made by the <em>Anther</em>) stick to it, because it is moving from two
        or more plants, pollen on the pollinator sticks to the <strong>Stigma</strong>.<br/><br/> The stigma is part of the female fart of the plant.</p>
        <h2>Fertilization</h2>
        <p>When the pollen sticks to the stigma, it forms pollen tubes and goes throught the style and into the ovule which are located in the ovary.<br/><br/></p>

        <h2>Fertilization</h2>
        <p>Once the pollen grows down the <strong>Style</strong>, it would go into the ovule.</p>
        <h2>Germination in the flower.</h2>
        <p><strong>In the ovules,</strong></p>  
        <p> As the pollen tube goes down the style, it goes into the ovules located in the ovary<br/><br/>
            in one of the ovules, then the there in an embryo, endosperm and <strong>Zygote</strong> the endosperm becomes a source of nutrition
            for the developing seeds.</p>
            <h2>Seed dispersation</h2>
            <p>There are different methods of seed dispersal<br/><br/>
            They are...</p>
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seed_dispersal" target="_blank">Wind Dispersal</a><br/><br/>
            <a href="https://www.arboretum.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Exploding-Seed-Pods-.pdf" target="_blank">Explosions</a>
            <p>E.T.C</p>
            <h2>Germination</h2>
            <p>A seed would fall onto the ground,and the first thing that grows is the roots.<br/><br/>
            The <em>roots</em> anchor the growing plant in the soil. Then the stem starts growing up and it starts sprouting.
            Then a flower grows and the cycle starts again</p>
